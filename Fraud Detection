Fraud Detection

Notes:
One of the most prominent use cases of anomaly detection. Nowadays, it is common to hear about events where oneâ€™s credit card number and related information get compromised.
This can, in turn, lead to abnormal behavior in the usage pattern of the credit cards. Therefore, to effectively detect these frauds, 
anomaly detection techniques should be used along with normal ML algorithms.

Problem definition:
Build a model that predicts whether a given transaction is fraudulent

Baseline Model:
Random Forest Regression

Feature Engineering:
PCA
KMeans
Imputation and encoding

Modelling:
split
scale
normalize
